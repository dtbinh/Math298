Math 298 Fundamental Concepts in Computational and Applied Math

These are the lecture notes for a 1-unit graduate course on Computational and Applied Math taught at UC Merced.
The course is loosely based on the idea of going over some of the classic papers in Numerical Analysis as first suggested
by Nick Trefethen and combined with the idea of the "7 Dwarfs" as proposed by Phil Colella.

Please see the course syllabus for a more complete description of this course.
