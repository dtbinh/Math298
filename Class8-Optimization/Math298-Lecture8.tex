\frame{\frametitle{Optimization and Nonlinear Equations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Optimization and nonlinear equations at the heart of many science and engineering problems
\item Many of the ideas/methods used in optimization are the same as in nonlinear equations
\item Can divide methods generically into derivative and non-derivative methods
\end{itemize}
For minimization we usually state the problem as: $\min f(x)$ \\
For nonlinear equations we usually state the problem as : Solve $F(x) = 0$

\section{Notation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Nonlinear Equations}

Suppose we have:

$$
F: \real^n \rightarrow \Rn
$$
then the problem of solving a set of nonlinear equations is given by:
$$
\mbox{find} \ \xstar \in \Rn  \ \mbox{such that} \ F(\xstar) = 0 \in \Rn
$$
} % end frame

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Miminization}

Suppose we have:

$$
f: \Rn \rightarrow \real
$$
then the problem of minimization is given by:
$$
\mbox{find} \ \xstar \in \Rn  \ \mbox{such that} \ f(\xstar) \leq f(x), \ \forall x \in \Rn
$$
{\color{red} Remark.} Another variation of this is the {\color{red} constrained version}, i.e.
$$
\min_{x \in \Omega \subset \Rn}  f:  \Rn \rightarrow \real
$$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Motivation}

Main approach to solving nonlinear equations/optimization can be viewed in several ways.
We will consider the {\color{red} model-based} approach

\begin{itemize}
\item Replace your nonlinear problem with a ``model"
\item Solve resulting model system
\item Check for convergence, iterate
\item So for example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Nonlinear equations can be replaced by a linear problem
\item Minimization problem can be replaced by a quadratic model
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

} % end frame

\section{Background}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Example 1}

Consider the problem of solving one equation in one unknown, $f(x) = 0$.

First replace $f(x)$ by a linear model $M_c(x)$:
$$
M_c(x) = f(x_c) + f^{\prime}(x_c)(x - x_c).
$$

Solving for $M_c(x) = 0$ we get:
\begin{eqnarray*}
f(x_c) + f^{\prime}(x_c)(x - x_c) &=& 0 \\
x - x_c & = &  - \frac{f(x_c)}{f^{\prime}(x_c)} \\
x &=& x_c  - \frac{f(x_c)}{f^{\prime}(x_c)}
\end{eqnarray*}
\vspace{.5in}
Question:  What does $M_c$ look like in the general $n-$dimensional case?
} % end frame


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Example 2}

Consider the problem of minimizing a general nonlinear function, $f(x)$.

First replace $f(x)$ by a quadratic model:

$$
m_c(x) = f(x_c) + f^{\prime}(x_c)(x - x_c) + \frac{1}{2} f^{\prime \prime}(x_c)(x - x_c)^2
$$

\vspace{.5in}
{\color{red} Remark.} We could have just as easily said that we would use our previous approach to solving $f^{\prime}(x) = 0 !$

      \item Convex
      \item Non-smooth
      \item Large-scale
      \item Stochastic
      \item $\ldots$
   \end{itemize}
\item Many Science and Engineering problems do not have the usual analytic assumptions
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Smoothness
     \item Availability of derivatives
     \item Infinite precision
