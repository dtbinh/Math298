\frame{\frametitle{Course Goals}

\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce fundamental concepts in computational and applied mathematics.
\item Highlight some of the classic NA papers and algorithms.
\item Demonstrate use of these concepts in real world applications.
\item We will not go into any one area in depth.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Learning Outcomes}

\begin{itemize}

\item Be familiar with key mathematical concepts used in developing numerical algorithms.
\item Understand some of the basic skills and resources necessary to start research in computational and applied mathematics.
\item Be aware of basic communications skills needed to present mathematics clearly to a
  broad audience in writing and in speaking.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Class participation is critical to getting the most out of this course

\frame{\frametitle{Theory vs. Practice}

\begin{itemize}
\item In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. \pause
\item In practice there is.

\end{itemize} 
} % end frame

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Finite Precision}

\begin{itemize}
\item Difference between infinite precision and computer arithmetic
\item You will always make an error when approximating a mathematical object on a computer
\item One of the major types of errors is discretization(truncation), which is the difference between the solution of the discrete problem and the exact solution of the mathematical object
\item Example: Suppose you have a function defined by an infinite series and you ``truncate" it at some point, e.g.

\begin{eqnarray*}
\exp(x) &=& 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} +  \frac{x^3}{3!} + \ldots \\
&\approx& 1 + x
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{itemize}

} % end frame

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame{\frametitle{Finite Precision}

\begin{itemize}
\item Another example

\begin{equation*}
f^{\prime} (x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} 
\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item How do we pick $h$ to get the best approximation? \pause
\item Discussion \pause
\item Lesson: Don't solve an approximate problem too exactly
\end{itemize}
