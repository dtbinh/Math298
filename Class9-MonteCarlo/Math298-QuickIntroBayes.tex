\frame[c]{\frametitle{Bayes Formula}

Combine (prior) information you have with new data, $D$, to update your understanding of a model:
\begin{equation}
P( \theta | D) = \frac{P(D | \theta)   P (\theta)}{\int \! P(D | \theta)   P (\theta) \mathrm{d} \theta}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $ P(\theta | D)  $ is called the \emph{posterior}
\item $ P(D | \theta)  $ is called the \emph{likelihood}
\item $ P(\theta) $ is called the \emph{prior}
\end{itemize}

The term
$$
m(x) = \int \! P(D | \theta)   P (\theta) \mathrm{d} \theta
$$
is called the {\em marginal density} of the random variable $X$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame[c]{\frametitle{Basic Idea}
\begin{itemize}

\item Replaced quantity of interest (posterior) with something that we are more likely to be able to compute
\item The prior represents our state of the knowledge before we analyze the data
\item The likelihood modifies this state once we've analyzed the new experimental data
\item is just a normalization constant in most cases
\end{itemize}
} % end frame

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\frame[c]{\frametitle{Bayes}

Of interest are various functions of the posterior (e.g. moments, quantiles, etc.), which can be expressed as expectations of functions of $\theta$:
\begin{equation}
E \left [ f(\theta) | D \right ] = \frac{ \int \! f(\theta) P(D | \theta)   P (\theta)  \mathrm{d} \theta}{\int \! P(D | \theta)   P (\theta) \mathrm{d} \theta}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Computation of the integrals have been the computational bottlenecks
\item In most applications no analytic expressions for the posterior are impossible
\end{itemize}
